Unfortunately, despite their I/O advantages, the in-storage computing capability as well as the memory capacity of existing CSDs can be up to two orders of magnitude lower than the host system, shifting the bottleneck from I/O to computing if CSDs alone were used to process large graphs. To address this problem, we propose TaijiGraph, which combines the weak computing engine inside a CSD that has high I/O bandwidth with powerful host processors that have limited I/O bandwidth to achieve high overall performance for out-of-core graph processing.
TaijiGraph leverages the strengths of the two computing systems by partitioning the input graph according to the degree of a vertex and dynamically assigning workloads to the host and the CSD subsequently. High-degree vertices, which typically result in a higher compute-to-memory ratio in many graph kernels, are processed by the host, while low-degree vertices that typically result in a lower compute-to-memory ratio are processed by the CSD. In addition, a linear performance predictor that depends on the number of active vertices and edges is developed to capture the dynamics of the graph processing tasks across the partitions and iterations.
Using this performance predictor, a lightweight runtime scheduler that dynamically offloads I/O-intensive graph processing tasks to CSD while leaving computing-intensive tasks on the host is proposed. On a system using a Cosmos+ OpenSSD prototype with a 30X weaker in-storage processor than the host, when compared to GraphChi and GridGraph implemented on the same system using a wide range of large graphs, TaijiGraph achieves an average performance speedup of 6.41X and 2.62X while reducing data transmission between the host and the CSD by 13.94X and 6.52X respectively, making it promising for use in future disaggregated computing and storage systems.</p> <p>[<a href="https://anonymous.4open.science/r/TaijiGraph2022" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TaijiGraph on Computational Storage<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg></a>]</p></div></div> <p><strong>RobustDL: Robust deep learning toolchain</strong> (Ongoing)</p> <p>We mainly investigate the design of deep learning toolchains all the way from deep learning applications to low-level circuit designs.

FPGAs with fine-grained reconfiguration capability can adapt the processing with distinct data width and models, and hence, can theoretically unleash the potential of MPNNs. Nevertheless, commodity DPUs on FPGAs mostly emphasize the generality and have limited support for MPNNs especially the ones with lower data width. In addition, primitive DSPs in FPGAs usually have much larger data width than that is required by MPNNs and haven’t been sufficiently co-explored with MPNNs yet. To this end, we propose an open source MPNN accelerator design framework specifically tailored for FPGAs. In this framework, we have a systematic DSP-packing algorithm to pack multiple lower data width MACs in a single primitive DSP and enable efficient implementation of MPNNs. Meanwhile, we take the DSP-packing efficiency into consideration with MPNN quantization within a unified neural network architecture search (NAS) framework such that it can be aware of the DSP overhead during quantization and optimize the MPNN performance and accuracy concurrently. Finally, we have the optimized MPNN fine-tuned to a fully pipelined neural network accelerator template based on HLS and make best use of available resources for higher performance. Our experiments reveal the resulting accelerators produced by the proposed framework can achieve overwhelming advantages in terms of performance, resource utilization, and inference accuracy for MPNNs when compared with both hand-crafted counterparts and prior hardware-aware neural network accelerators on FPGAs.</p> <p>[<a href="https://anonymous.4open.science/r/NASPacking-8B1F/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mixed Precision Neural Network Acceleration on FPGAs<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg></a>]</p> <p>[<a href="https://github.com/Liu-Cheng/bfs_with_Intel_OpenCL.git" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BFS Acceleration with Intel OpenCL<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg></a>]</p></div></div> <div class="md-card show-border"><!----> <div class="card-content"><p><strong>DeepBurning: Automatic generation of FPGA-based learning accelerators for the neural network family</strong> (2018-2020)</p> <p>DeepBurning is an end-to-end automatic neural network accelerator design tool for specialized learning tasks.
